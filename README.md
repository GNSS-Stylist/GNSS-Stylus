You can also run Doom with this (although special version is needed, see below) as in video:
- Can it run Doom? Yes, but you need to run too!: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vyy6DvKuNs
- Special version of GNSS-stylus you needed for you to run Doom: https://github.com/GNSS-Stylist/GNSS-Stylus/releases/tag/DRY_V1.0.0 / https://github.com/GNSS-Stylist/GNSS-Stylus/tree/DoomRunsYou
